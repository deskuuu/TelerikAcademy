Strings are sequences of characters.Each character is a Unicode symbo, 
represented by the string data type in C# (System.String).
String objects contain an immutable (read-only) sequence of characters.
Strings use Unicode to support multiple languages and alphabets.
Strings are stored in the dynamic memory (managed heap).
System.String is reference type.
String objects are like arrays of characters (char[]).
They have fixed length (String.Length).
Elements can be accessed directly by index.
The index is in the range [0...Length-1].

Most important string processing members are:
 Length, this[], Compare(str1, str2), IndexOf(str), LastIndexOf(str), 
 Substring(startIndex, length), Replace(oldStr, newStr), Remove(startIndex, length), ToLower(), ToUpper(), Trim();
Objects can be converted to strings and can be formatted in different styles (using ToString() method).
Strings can be constructed by using placeholders and formatting strings (String.Format(…)).
